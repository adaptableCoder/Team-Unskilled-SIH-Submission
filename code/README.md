## Tasks Accomplished

- [x] **Mobile app skeleton:** Created a React Native / Expo app under `main/` with core screens and components for trip capture and UI (folders: `app/`, `components/`, `assets/`, `hooks/`, `store/`,  `etc.`).
- [x] **Core features:** Implemented core features asked in the problem statement including but not limited to:
  - Auto GPS tracking
  - Manual trip details input
  - AI-based trip planning

## Technology Stack

This project leverages the following technologies:

- **[REACT NATIVE](https://reactnative.dev/):** Chosen for its ability to build cross-platform mobile applications using TypeScript and React.

## Key Features

- **Auto GPS Tracking:** Automatically captures the user's location during trips.
- **Trip Details Input:** Allows users to manually input trip details such as destination, mode of transport, and companions, if the app is unable to auto-detect.
- **AI Trip Planner:** Utilizes AI to suggest optimal routes and modes of transport based on user preferences and historical data.
